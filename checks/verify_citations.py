"""The pre-submission citation gate. Run it before the manuscript leaves the building.

Four failures, all blocking, each corresponding to a real way a bibliography goes wrong:

  1 UNDEFINED KEY      the text cites a key that is not in references.bib. LaTeX renders this as
                       [?] and it is the most common way a fabricated citation survives -- it was
                       typed straight into the text and never entered the bibliography at all.
  2 DEAD DOI           the entry exists but its DOI no longer resolves at Crossref. Either the DOI
                       was wrong from the start or the record was withdrawn; both matter.
  3 UNSUPPORTED CLAIM  the citation is real and resolves, but claims_ledger.csv has no sentence
                       from the source backing the claim it is attached to. This is the failure a
                       DOI check cannot catch and the one a referee in the field WILL catch.
  4 UNCITED ENTRY      references.bib carries an entry nothing cites. Harmless to a reader, but it
                       usually means a citation was removed from the text and the claim it
                       supported is now unsupported.

Exit code is non-zero if anything blocks, so this can gate a commit hook or CI.
