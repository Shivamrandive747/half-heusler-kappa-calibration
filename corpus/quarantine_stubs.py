"""Quarantine every extraction made from an Elsevier entitlement stub — durably.

An earlier attempt flagged the MEASUREMENTS table. That does not survive: s05 calls
db.clear_paper_samples() and rebuilds measurements from extractions.raw_json, so Phase 4
and Phase 5 silently restored 7,611 fabricated rows (1,813 of them kappa). Anything meant
to persist has to sit on `extractions`, which s05 reads, not on `measurements`, which it
regenerates.

Detection is by CONTENT, not size. The previous `_MIN_BODY_BYTES = 3000` heuristic was
calibrated on stubs of 580-2,915 B, but Elsevier returns coredata-only responses up to
130,455 B when an article carries long reference lists — 226 of those cleared the gate.
The reliable signature is structural: a <full-text-retrieval-response> that contains no
<ce:para> or <ce:section> has no body text at all, whatever its size.

Nothing is deleted. raw_json is preserved for audit, and setting status='stub_source'
leaves the paper eligible for re-extraction once a real PDF is downloaded.
