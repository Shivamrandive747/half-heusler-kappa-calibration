"""Add 7 experimentally-measured half Heuslers that were extracted years ago and then silently
dropped for missing structure metadata.

WHERE THESE CAME FROM. Not from new mining -- from our own `heusler.sqlite`. It holds 152 half-Heusler
compounds with a lattice-kappa value, but only a subset ever reached the training set, because
`resolve_structures.py` requires a sourced lattice constant and discards anything without one. The
measurements were fine; the structure metadata was thin. That is a pipeline gap, not a data gap, and
it will keep discarding future extractions until it is fixed.

FILTERING THAT MATTERS. The database mixes computed and measured rows in the same table -- 565 of
752 half-Heusler lattice-kappa rows are `data_origin = 'theoretical'` (DFT, ShengBTE, Slack's
model). An earlier pass that skipped this filter produced 83 "recoverable" compounds, nearly all of
them DFT. With the filter it is 7. `ZrSbIr` is the live trap: the same paper reports BOTH measured
and first-principles values, so it must be filtered per row, not per compound. `LuNiBi` looked like
an ultralow-kappa prize at 0.11-0.35 W/m/K until the same filter showed every row was theoretical --
its source (10.1039/d1tc02819g) is a pure DFT paper.

`MnSiNi` is excluded: its single 0.22 W/m/K point is documented in this project's own code as a
digitisation artefact.

LATTICE CONSTANTS, and the sqrt(2) trap. Four compounds carry XRD-refined constants from their own
papers. Three needed sourcing, and the sources disagree in a way that is entirely explained by
convention: AFLOW and JARVIS publish the PRIMITIVE fcc edge, others the CONVENTIONAL cubic edge, and
the ratio is sqrt(2). Two independent cross-checks confirm the reading rather than assuming it:

    LuSbPt   AFLOW 4.5799 x sqrt2 = 6.477   vs experimental 6.4677 (Hou 2015, Rietveld)
    AlVNi    JARVIS 4.0321 x sqrt2 = 5.702  vs our own XRD-refined 5.70

Every value below is the CONVENTIONAL cubic edge, and the provenance of each is recorded.

WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT WORTH. It takes the experimental set from 46 to 53 compounds, ~15%. That
will not move the headline accuracy -- with 46 compounds the noise band is about +/-7 percentage
points and 7 more does not change that. What it does is thicken the 1.8-3.8 W/m/K region, where our
error is worst and our coverage thinnest, and it costs nothing because the data was already paid for.
