"""Merge the per-paper Gemini extractions into one file, separating PRIMARY from QUOTED values.

THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. A paper's kappa table routinely contains three kinds of number:

  1. what THIS paper computed or measured            -- primary, usable
  2. what this paper QUOTES from earlier papers      -- secondary, must not be counted again
  3. reference materials for comparison (PbTe, ...)  -- not Heuslers at all

Phys. Rev. B 95, 045202 Table I is the clean example: 26 rows, but only 3 are "RTA-BTE (this work)".
The other 23 are labelled `Theory [53]`, `Experimental [18]` and so on -- values lifted from the
bibliography. Ingesting those would double-count the originals we already hold and would make
independent sources look like they agree with each other, which is the worst possible failure for a
cross-check.

DETECTION. A method string is secondary if it names a bracketed reference (`[18]`, `[53]`) or says
"literature". This is a syntactic rule over what the model transcribed, not a judgement call.

Non-Heusler comparison materials are left alone here -- `build_kappa_pool.py` already drops anything
that is not a Heusler stoichiometry, so PbTe and Bi2Te3 fall out there.
