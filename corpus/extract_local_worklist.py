"""Extract the screened local PDFs, highest-promise first.

`run_extraction.py` builds its worklist from the fetch LOGS, so 1,304 PDFs that were added by hand
had never been offered to it. Screening found 630 that mention both a Heusler term and thermal
conductivity, 280 of them naming a FULL Heusler -- the class the model is starved of.

The DOI is recovered from the filename, which is how every other stage of this pipeline names its
files: `10.1002_adfm.201300663` -> `10.1002/adfm.201300663`. Only the FIRST underscore is a slash;
the rest belong to the suffix. Files whose names are not DOI-shaped (`1-s2.0-...-main`) are still
extracted, tagged with a `local:` identifier, so a real table is never thrown away for want of a
tidy filename -- but they are marked so provenance stays honest.
