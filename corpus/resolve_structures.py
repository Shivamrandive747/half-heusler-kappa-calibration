"""Attach a REAL, CITED structure to every compound in the kappa pool -- or admit there isn't one.

THE RULE THIS FILE ENFORCES
---------------------------
A structure is attached only when a named source supplies it, with a resolvable identifier. Nothing
is ever synthesised, guessed, averaged from neighbours, or estimated from an ionic-radius sum. A
compound with no sourced lattice constant is marked `grade D` and EXCLUDED from the
structure-required training set -- it is not quietly filled in.

This matters because the project has already had 1,571 fabricated measurements enter the database
once (see the Elsevier coredata stub incident). An invented lattice constant would be the same
failure in a new place, and harder to spot, because a plausible-looking `a` for a Heusler is easy to
produce and impossible to distinguish from a real one after the fact.

THE GRADES -- what "has a structure" actually means
--------------------------------------------------
  A  full explicit structure: lattice + species + fractional coordinates, all from the source
  B  lattice constant + space group + the source states WHICH element sits on which site
  C  lattice constant + space group + Heusler prototype, but the source does not state the site
     ordering. The Wyckoff positions of C1b/L2_1/XA are fixed by the prototype and are standard
     crystallography, not invention -- but which of the three elements occupies 4a/4b/4c changes
     kappa, and if the source is silent we say so rather than pick one.
  D  NO sourced lattice constant anywhere. Excluded. Reported by name, never filled in.

PROVENANCE ON EVERY ROW: `struct_source`, `struct_source_url`, `struct_source_detail` (the literal
description the harvest recorded, e.g. "alatt column (AFLOW T0003 relaxed lattice constant, same
table as kappa)") and `struct_same_paper_as_kappa`.

PREFERENCE ORDER. A structure from the SAME paper/file that produced the kappa value is preferred
over one from an unrelated database, because a kappa is only consistent with the cell it was
computed in. Where they disagree by more than 2% the disagreement is reported, not silently resolved.

PRIMITIVE vs CONVENTIONAL -- MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED
--------------------------------------------------
A first run showed 524 of 622 compounds "disagreeing" by more than 2%, worst 66%. That was not bad
data: some sources publish the PRIMITIVE fcc edge and others the CONVENTIONAL cubic edge, which
differ by exactly sqrt(2). Rather than assume which is which, every source was regressed against
JARVIS's explicitly-named `a_conventional_cubic_A`:

    source            n shared   median ratio    verdict
    MP                    480         1.0022     conventional
    OQMD                   21         1.0026     conventional
    Carrete 2014           56         1.0036     conventional
    Sci.Rep. 2021         103         0.9973     conventional
    repository mining     154         1.0200     conventional
    PhononDB `a`           44         1.0126     conventional
    PhononDB `prim_a`      44         1.4320     PRIMITIVE
    AFLOW `geometry[0]`   289         1.4103     PRIMITIVE     (sqrt2 = 1.4142)
    MP `structure.lattice.a` 401      1.4113     PRIMITIVE  <- despite the bare name `a`
    HH130 `prim_a`        110         1.4159     PRIMITIVE

Four columns are primitive and are multiplied by sqrt(2); everything else is left alone. The last
two were caught only on a second pass, when the cross-check 90th percentile sat at 43.8% -- almost
exactly sqrt(2)-1. Every row records `lattice_convention` so the conversion is visible and
reversible. This project once made the OPPOSITE error -- applying sqrt(2) where both sides were
already primitive, which manufactured a fake 29% mismatch -- which is why the direction is measured
each run rather than remembered.

AFTER all four corrections and the polymorph gate, 600 compounds carry two or more independent
lattice constants and agree to a median of 1.82%, 90% within 5%, 99% within 10%. That residue is
ordinary exchange-correlation-functional scatter (PBE vs PBEsol vs LDA), not error.
