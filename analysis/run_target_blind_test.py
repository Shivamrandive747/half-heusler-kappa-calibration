"""Blind test on the TARGET LIST: predict the targets we already have data for.

THE TEST THAT WAS MISSING. Every accuracy number in this project so far came from a 24-compound
validation set or from cross-validation over the training pool. But 154 of the 258 stoichiometric
Heusler targets already carry a kappa value -- 64 experimental, 128 full-BTE -- so they can be held
out, predicted, and scored against a real number. That is a direct measurement of how well we
predict the actual deliverable, and it had never been run.

HOW THE HOLDOUT WORKS. Removing just the compound is not enough: `ZrCoSb` sits among 40 other
Co-site half Heuslers, so leaving those in makes the prediction interpolation. Each fold removes
THE WHOLE CHEMISTRY CLUSTER (X2 element for full Heuslers, X-site element for half), reusing
`cluster_of()` from run_loco_chemistry.py, and asserts the cluster is really gone.

THREE RULES THAT KEEP THE NUMBER HONEST:

  1. SCORE PER COMPOUND, NEVER PER ROW. The previously reported 36.5% was a per-row median; on the
     same data the per-compound median was 84.3%, because compounds with many temperature points
     dominated the row pool.
  2. EXPERIMENT AND DFT ARE NEVER POOLED. Agreement with a first-principles calculation and
     agreement with a measured sample are different claims and get separate tables.
  3. A LOW REFERENCE IS FLAGGED AND STILL COUNTED. Compounds whose MEDIAN reference sits below
     0.5 W/m/K are listed for the reader's judgement but remain in every statistic. Two earlier
     versions of this rule were wrong in opposite directions: one dropped them from the printed
     figures despite this docstring promising otherwise (which flattered the result, and would have
     discarded `MgAgSb` at 0.70 W/m/K -- a real ultralow-kappa half Heusler, not an artefact), and
     the flag itself fired on `.any()` over temperature rows, so a single low-temperature point
     condemned `VCoSn` even though its median reference is 6.55 W/m/K.

    from_folder=True forces the folder scan. ONLY freeze_release_inputs.py passes it, to regenerate the
