"""The honest headline: accuracy measured on compounds that took no part in ANY design choice.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Every number reported so far was measured on the same 64 compounds that were used
to choose the correction's functional form (8+ candidates were compared by their accuracy on these
compounds), its fitting objective (rows vs per-compound), and the chemistry-support threshold
(MIN_SUPPORT=3 was picked after tabulating which compounds it removed and what that did to the
median). Those are three model-selection decisions made on the evaluation set. The resulting figure
is therefore optimistic by an unknown amount, and "unknown" is not publishable.

This script measures the amount. Each repeat:

  1. splits the compounds 50/50 into a DESIGN half and a TEST half,
  2. on the DESIGN half only: sweeps functional form, objective and support threshold, and picks
     the combination that scores best there,
  3. freezes every choice and applies it, untouched, to the TEST half,
  4. records the TEST-half accuracy.

The distribution of step 4 over many repeats is the honest estimate. The gap between it and the
design-half score is the winner's curse, measured rather than assumed.

THE SPLIT IS BY CHEMISTRY CLUSTER, NOT BY COMPOUND. This is the subtle part. The base predictions
come from one model per chemistry cluster (`run_target_blind_test.py` fits a model per cluster and
applies it to every member), so two compounds in the same cluster share that model's idiosyncratic
bias and are NOT independent. Splitting by compound would put `ScSbRu2` in DESIGN and `NbInRu2` in
TEST while both were predicted by the identical model -- leakage through the shared fold. The 64
compounds contain only ~27 clusters, so the effective sample is much smaller than it looks, and the
honest split respects that.

WHERE THE CONSTANT IS FITTED (since 2026-10-05, paper/evidence/PREREG_shared_constant_on_calculations.md).
The candidate (c, p) are no longer fitted on the design half's MODEL PREDICTIONS. Each candidate is
fitted on the published calculation / measurement pairs (shared_constant.pairs()) with every pair of
the TEST half's chemistry clusters removed; the published combination (capped power, per-compound)
is exactly shared_constant.shared_cp_without_clusters(test clusters). The design half still SELECTS
form, objective and threshold by scoring the model predictions under each candidate, and the choice
is frozen and applied to the test half, so the winner's curse is still measured.

WHAT IS SWEPT (the same space that was explored informally):
  forms      capped power law  min(c*(T/300)^p, 1)   -- the published choice
             uncapped power    c*(T/300)^p
             flat              c                      -- pure bias removal, the null model
  objective  median over rows  |  median of per-compound medians
  threshold  minimum chemistry support in {0, 2, 3, 4, 6}
