"""Chemistry support per cluster, counting FIRST-PRINCIPLES compounds only.

WHY THIS IS ITS OWN SCRIPT NOW. The >=3-support exclusion rule was validated against blind-test
errors, then applied to the novel predictions -- but the counts it used came from the whole training
pool, which includes 160 rows of tier-3 semi-empirical AFLOW-AGL Debye-Gruneisen estimates spanning
143 compounds. So a novel compound could be declared "predictable" on the strength of chemistry
whose only labels are semi-empirical. Three of the thirteen novel predictions were in exactly that
position -- `Cu2GePd`, `ZnGaCu2` and `AlZnAg2` had 12-20 "supporting" compounds and **zero** with a
full-BTE label.

An AGL estimate is a fitted approximation to kappa, not a measurement and not a converged
Boltzmann-transport solution. Counting it as evidence that a chemistry is learnable overstates the
case, so `n_compounds` here is the count of tier-1 (full BTE) compounds. The total and the
semi-empirical-only count are kept alongside it so the difference stays visible rather than being
quietly redefined.

An earlier version of this count read `HEUSLER_KAPPA_TRAINING_SET.csv` filtered to tier <= 1, which
missed the `extra_csv` gap rows entirely and was wrong for 39 of 64 blind-test compounds. The count
must come from the pool the model ACTUALLY trains on, which is what `ds.build()` returns.
