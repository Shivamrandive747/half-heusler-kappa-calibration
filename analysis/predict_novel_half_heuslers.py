"""The actual deliverable: experimental-scale kappa_L for the novel half Heuslers, with gates.

TWO BUGS THIS FIXES in `predict_novel_targets.py`, both of which made its numbers unusable as
experimental predictions:

1. NO CALIBRATION WAS APPLIED. That script trains on tier-1 BTE labels and reports the model's raw
   output, which lives on the DFT scale. Our own blind test measures raw DFT at ~92% away from
   experiment and the raw model at 1.66x high. The validated pipeline is
   `kappa_expt = kappa_DFT * min(c*(T/300)^p, 1)` with c = 0.480, p = +0.350, fit with the
   compound's whole chemistry withheld from both model and calibration. Without it `ZrGaCu` reads
   18.24 W/m/K where the calibrated estimate is 8.76.

2. THE INTERVAL CAME FROM THE WRONG POPULATION. Its band is a conformal band over FULL-Heusler
   out-of-fold residuals (`conformal((b["y"] - oof)[isfull])`), so a half-Heusler prediction was
   handed a full-Heusler band built from DFT-vs-DFT cross-validation. That measures how well the
   model reproduces other calculations, not how well it predicts a measurement. The bands here come
   from `validate_intervals.py`, calibrated on individual model-vs-experiment residuals with the
   chemistry cluster held out, and checked: 50/80/90 nominal -> 51/83/90 actual.

A THIRD TRAP, found while writing this. The spreadsheet holds all 25 CANDIDATES, but three of them
(`FeGeMo`, `NbGaNi`, `NbInNi`) were re-verified as already published. An earlier version of this
printout issued 7 compounds because those three were still counted as novel. Only the 22 rows whose
verdict in NOVELTY_REVERIFIED.csv is `novel` may appear here.

THE GATE. A prediction is issued only where the X-site chemistry has >= 3 tier-1 compounds behind
it. That threshold is not arbitrary: chemistries with 0-2 supporting compounds score 60% median
blind error against 29-42% above it. Below the gate we print a refusal and the reason, which for Zn
and Ag is that nobody has ever measured OR computed kappa for that site.
