"""Every statistic Section 4 reports, computed once, under one scope.

WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS. The results in this project accumulated over months and were computed under
whichever scope was current at the time: the null baselines on all 51 compounds, the rank
correlation on all 51, the family table on the in-domain 38, the headline on the in-domain 38. Each
was correct when written. Quoting them side by side in one Results section would not be, because a
reader would take them as a single comparison and they are not.

So the section reads from one file, produced here, with one definition of scope applied to
everything: the declared domain of applicability (VEC = 18, cubic and non-polymorphic), with the
excluded compounds reported alongside rather than discarded.

Both nulls are fitted with the same chemistry held out as the calibration. A null handed less
information than the method is not a test of the method, and a referee will say so.

    This was previously done in sample: (c, p) were fitted once on all in-domain compounds and then
    used to score those same compounds, while the null baselines below were fitted leave-one-out.
    The model was therefore being compared against nulls held to a stricter standard than itself,
    and the paper's claim that every reported figure is obtained with the compound's chemistry
    withheld was not true of the calibration.

    The effect is small -- two parameters over 38 compounds carry little freedom, and the honest
    median is 31.0% against the 29.7% obtained in sample -- but "small" is not "absent", and the
    fix costs nothing.
