"""Re-validate the chemistry-support exclusion rule under the STRICT (BTE-only) definition.

WHY THIS IS NECESSARY. The rule "refuse a target whose chemistry holds fewer than 3 training
compounds" was validated against blind-test errors while support was counted over ALL training
tiers -- which included 160 rows of semi-empirical AFLOW-AGL estimates spanning 143 compounds. The
count has since been tightened to first-principles (tier-1) compounds only, because three novel
predictions turned out to be "supported" by 12-20 compounds with ZERO BTE labels among them.

Tightening the definition without re-testing the threshold would be inheriting a number that was
measured on something else. That is exactly the kind of silent redefinition this project has been
bitten by before, so the rule is re-derived here from scratch under the new count.

WHAT IS MEASURED. For each candidate threshold: how many blind-test compounds it refuses, the median
error of those refused, and the median error and within-2x of those kept. A threshold earns its place
only if the compounds it refuses are genuinely worse than the ones it keeps. Half and full Heuslers
are reported separately, because the strict count collapses almost every full-Heusler cluster to zero
and a single pooled threshold would be dominated by that.
