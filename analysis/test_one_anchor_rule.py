"""Would a ONE-anchor family rule have been safe? Leave-one-out simulation.

The observation that prompted this: compounds whose family held exactly one usable anchor scored
6 of 6 within a factor of two, as good as those with two or more. If that holds, the family rule
could be k=1 instead of k=2, and Ni-Bi would need ONE measurement rather than two -- releasing
nine to eleven predictions for a single experiment.

But that observation is contaminated. "Families with one anchor" was computed with the target
compound's own family membership counted from the full table, so a compound can be its own
support. The honest question is counterfactual and must be asked leave-one-out:

    for each measured compound c, count the usable anchors in c's family EXCLUDING c.
    Under a k-anchor rule, c would have been predicted iff that count >= k.
    Then: of the compounds a k=1 rule ADMITS THAT k=2 DOES NOT, how accurate are they?

That last group is the entire question. If those are as good as the k=2 group, the rule can be
relaxed. If they are not, the observation was an artefact and k=2 stands.

Reports the decision either way. A relaxation is only worth adopting if the newly admitted
compounds hold up on their own, not if the pooled average survives.
