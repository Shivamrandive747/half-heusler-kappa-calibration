"""Run the nested protocol across MODEL SEEDS, not just across chemistry splits.

THE LIMITATION THIS CLOSES. `nested_validation.py` resamples the chemistry split 200 times, but it
reads ONE fixed set of predictions -- `target_blind_test.csv`, produced with `random_seed=0`. So its
5th-95th range describes "which chemistries landed in the test half" and says nothing about model
seed. That matters here: across five seeds the per-compound median moves 38.5% to 42.0%, and seed 0
sits at the favourable end. Quoting a seed-0 nested figure as the headline repeats, in miniature,
the error that manufactured a 13.6 pp hurdle "gain" earlier in this project -- a single draw
reported as if it were the effect.

WHAT THIS DOES. For each of the five seed prediction files it runs the identical nested protocol
(200 cluster-level 50/50 splits, form/objective/threshold chosen on the design half and applied
frozen to the test half), then reports the distribution ACROSS seeds of the honest test-half median.
The headline becomes the median of those, with the seed range beside it.

Both thresholds are run because they answer different questions:
    threshold free  -- the published protocol, which selects a support filter on the design half
    threshold 0     -- unconditional, every half Heusler scored, no compound dropped
