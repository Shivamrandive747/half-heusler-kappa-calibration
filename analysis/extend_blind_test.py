"""The calibrated blind test, with the three defects an audit found in the first version fixed.

WHAT THE CALIBRATION IS. Raw predictions are BULK kappa -- what a perfect infinite crystal would
show, because the training labels are first-principles BTE calculations. Nobody measures that. The
over-prediction is systematic in temperature (3.70x at 200 K falling to ~1.0x by 900 K), with the
sign and magnitude grain-boundary scattering demands, so it is removed with two constants:

    kappa_experimental = kappa_bulk * min(c * (T/300)^p, 1)

THREE FIXES OVER THE PREVIOUS VERSION, each of which was inflating the reported accuracy:

  1. THE HOLDOUT IS NOW BY CHEMISTRY CLUSTER, NOT BY COMPOUND. The base predictions come from one
     model per cluster (`run_target_blind_test.py` fits per cluster and applies to every member), so
     two compounds sharing a cluster share that model's bias and are not independent. Fitting the
     calibration leave-one-COMPOUND-out let a held-out compound's cluster-mates inform its own
     correction. The 64 compounds hold only ~27 clusters, so this matters.

  2. THE OBJECTIVE MATCHES THE SCORING. Everything is reported as a per-compound median, but the
     first version minimised the median over ROWS, which lets heavily-measured compounds dominate
     and optimises central accuracy at the cost of catastrophic misses. Measured cost of getting
     this wrong: full Heuslers 46.1% vs 36.7%, half-Heusler within-2x 70% vs 80%.

  3. THE HONEST ACCURACY IS THE PER-FOLD NUMBER, REPORTED SEPARATELY FROM THE PUBLISHED CONSTANTS.
     Taking the median of all fold fits and then scoring compounds with it is leaky -- every other
     fold saw the compound being scored. So two things are printed and they are NOT the same:
       - ACCURACY: each compound scored with the calibration from a fit that excluded its cluster.
       - PUBLISHED CONSTANTS: one (c, p) fitted on everything, for applying to NEW compounds.
     Quoting the second as if it produced the first is the mistake this version refuses to make.

The genuinely leakage-free headline is `nested_validation.py`, which also holds out the form,
objective and support threshold. This script is the descriptive layer beneath it.

RULES KEPT FROM THE FIRST VERSION:
  - scored PER COMPOUND, never per row;
  - half and full Heuslers never pooled;
  - low references are FLAGGED, never dropped (an earlier 0.5 W/m/K floor wrongly condemned
    MgAgSb, a real ultralow-kappa half Heusler).
