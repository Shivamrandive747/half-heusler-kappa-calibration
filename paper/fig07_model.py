"""Figure 7 -- why this model, and what it learned.

TWO QUESTIONS A REFEREE WILL ASK, NEITHER OF WHICH THE PAPER CURRENTLY ANSWERS.

(a) DOES THE CHOICE OF REGRESSOR MATTER? Four were trained on identical data -- the same 4,765
    rows, the same 17 selected descriptors, the same grouped cross-validation with whole
    chemistries held out. They finish close together: CatBoost has the best R^2 on log-kappa
    (0.897) while the Gaussian process has the best median error (19.9% against 21.6%), a spread
    of under two percentage points across four quite different model families. The useful reading
    is not "we chose the winner" but that the result does not hinge on the regressor. A stored
    comparison claiming CatBoost led on every metric could not be reproduced from the present
    corpus and was re-run; these are the current numbers.

(b) DID IT LEARN PHONON PHYSICS, OR AN ARTEFACT? A tree ensemble reaching R^2 = 0.91 on log-kappa
    is only reassuring if the features it leans on are the ones physics says should matter. Panel
    (b) is a SHAP decomposition: for every row, how much each descriptor moved the prediction, and
    in which direction. If mass and bond length dominate with the expected signs, the model is
    doing thermal transport rather than memorising a lookup table.

SHAP is computed by CatBoost natively (`type="ShapValues"`), so this adds no dependency. Values
are in log10(kappa) units, which is the space the model is fitted in -- a SHAP value of -0.3 means
that descriptor pushed the prediction down by a factor of two.

COLOUR. The beeswarm uses viridis for the descriptor's own value, low to high, with an explicit
colourbar. That ramp is used nowhere else in the paper: the accent blue means "our result" and the
inferno ramp in Figure 2 means temperature, so neither can be spent here.
